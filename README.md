# Conquering-Responsive-Layouts
## CSS Tips learned from Challenge 1: 
### Avoid using height in most scenarios:
#### The web is naturally responsive, when you start adding height in your CSS you are essentially taking away that responsiveness
#### Utilize padding to control the size of your spacing instead of adding height
### It is best to use Percentages rather fixed widths to make our lives easier:
#### Keep in mind it is the percentage of it's parent element width and the most parent element is the viewport 
#### I typically avoid using width with child elements as well when possible
